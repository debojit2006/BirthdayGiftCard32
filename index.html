            <div class="letter-body">
                <p>To Bahnishikha,</p>
                <p>Hey you ðŸŒ¸</p>
                <p>I just wanted to take a moment and let you know how genuinely grateful I am to have you in my life. You have this calm way of making everything around you feel a little more peaceful â€” like sitting near a window while it rains, or hearing your favorite old song when you least expect it.</p>
                <p>Conversations with you never feel forced. They're easy, real, and somehow always leave me smiling afterward. It's rare to find someone who can just be â€” no drama, no show, just pure and true. Youâ€™re that kind of rare.</p>
                <p>And maybe itâ€™s just me, but the way you see the world? It's something else. The way you notice the little things, the way you care quietly â€” it all speaks louder than you know. People like that stay with you, even in silence.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, in the middle of an ordinary day, Iâ€™ll catch myself smiling out of nowhere â€” and more often than not, itâ€™s something you said or did. Funny how some people make the background of your life feel a bit more vivid. Like maybe the colors were always thereâ€¦ but they only started making sense after someone helped you see them properly.</p>
                <p>You probably wonâ€™t even realize how much your presence means to those around you. And thatâ€™s what makes it all the more beautiful.</p>
                <p>Anyway, just wanted to say thanks â€” for being you. ðŸŒ·</p>
                <p>No expectations. Just appreciation.<br>Always rooting for you,</p>
                <p>â€” Debojit</p>
